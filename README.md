# Logging
I wanted a tool to inspect and report on the ADIF files I get from my FT-8 ham radio
software. The file is automatic and a bit bare bones so I wanted to add the country
and the continent so I could sort on them.

To get the country, well actually DXCC, data I download a file from the ARRL that is
intended to be man-readable and unscramble that. I don't even think it is very man
readable as I can't deduce any certain rules that it doesn't break a few line further
down but I think I have a handle on things so it decodes even the Russian entry.

This is take 1. No sorting yet but I wanted to archive the country code source safely
as it took a while to derive and test.
